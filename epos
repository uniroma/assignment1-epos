# - df.iloc[0, 1:]: This selects the first row (index 0) of the DataFrame df, starting from the second 
# column (1:) until the end. This effectively excludes the first column, which you likely don't need 
# as it contains series names

# - reset_index(): This resets the index of the DataFrame, assigning a new index starting from 0. By 
# default, it will also move the existing index to a new column, which can be avoided if you don't need 
# it.
